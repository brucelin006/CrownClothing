# Crown-clothing E-commerce App

This project is built with **ReactJS** and deployed onto **Netlify** with [link](https://sage-pithivier-1cb2d5.netlify.app/). 

This project leverages:
 - the use of **Redux** as the global state management
 - **Firebase** as the database for both product storage and user logins and registrations.
 - **TypeScript** instead of regular JSX for scalable future codebase maintenance
 - **Styled-Components** as styling for better integration with React
 - **Redux-saga** as the side-effect state management as well as **Redux-persist** for persisting and rehydrating the redux store
 - **Stripe** API for credit card payments
